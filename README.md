# ML_and_DL
In the following code we compute Linear Regression for Boston data without using models (we construct our solution using sklearn's linear algebra functions). We restrict the problem to be one dimensional (only one feature, which we know from previous exploratoins that has more correlation with the target from the rest of features)

In the following code we compute Linear Regression for Boston data without using models (we construct our solution using sklearn's linear algebra functions). In this case we consider all the features (but no feature engineering)

Classical examples of ML and DL (Regression, Classification, Dimensional Reduction, Clustering) for my own understanding and practice.
